# SensESP Project Template

This repository forked from SignalK/SensESP(https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP/)

There are two source files in src, one for analog and one for digital.  Both show aggregation of mulitple values.  To combine Digital and Anlog, just glue them together and delete any double entries.  All work off of the same platform.ini. Pick the src file you want to use and rename it to amin and copy to /src.
